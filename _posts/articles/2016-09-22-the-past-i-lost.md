*The past I lost,*

*in the maze of time.*

*An ecstasy crumbled,*

*which was once mine.*

*A hurricane of change,*

*destroyed the palace of love,*

*a drop of the veil,*

*scattered all the doves.*

*And now nothing remains to be done,*

*except repent,*

*and remember the days,*

*that were in glory spent.*
