<p>I would like to start with a story I came across few days back about a possible future event,</p>

<p>or perhaps my imagination. It’s about year 2144, what’s the need of being so precise about</p>

<p>the date in our hazy future? Not at all! But I required one at least. Being taught to always</p>

<p>have faith in the divine force that unites all beings, I wanted one character in the story to</p>

<p>reflect this divine force, let’s call him the Great Artist. At the beginning of life the Great</p>

<p>Artist as I said created all life forms on earth differentiated and varied with possibilities. But</p>

<p>amongst all his makings the only masterpiece he had was man. Man surprised him when</p>

<p>he suddenly got up on two limbs and started to use his extra limbs to eat, cook, and create</p>

<p>shelter for himself. Overjoyed with the feats of his finest creation and its abilities the Great</p>

<p>Artist wished to see more.</p>

<p>Although with modest stems and a humble start each one this species had a zest to learn</p>

<p>and progress. They no more reflected the untamed behaviour of the wild, but instead lived</p>

<p>in formations and groups.They developed compassion for their fellows and passed their</p>

<p>knowledge as legacies to their children.Not very long after this the Great Artist noticed that</p>

<p>there was one thing man couldn’t control himself for and that was his vigour for advancing</p>

<p>ahead in life. No matter how much the Great Artist provided him he wasn’t satisfied , rather</p>

<p>made himself feel granted towards them owing to his intelligence. Soon the man found out</p>

<p>that he was still imperfect with his wishes and his creator didn’t gave him abilities he</p>

<p>wished to possess, thus came the machines. Beginning from the very modest bullock cart</p>

<p>wheels they progressed and soon became an integrated part man’s life. Machines gave</p>

<p>rise to industrial revolution and soon became an inseparable part of human’s life, nearing</p>

<p>to 21st century man had inherited enough complex and developed machines from his</p>

<p>ancestors whom in turn from their own, that the continuous interaction between him and</p>

<p>machines no longer seemed alien to him. Uproar of these artificial machines didn’t please</p>

<p>the Great Artist, his mind was in turmoil, he probably didn’t like the prayers emailed to him</p>

<p>or online enchantings played during poojas. Over the period of time it occurred to him that</p>

<p>a change was required things had already reached the bitter end. Man, although calling</p>

<p>him an intelligent being, had made the stupidest of mistakes that threatened the survival of</p>

<p>not only his but the entire existence of all living beings on the planet. Overpopulation</p>

<p>created scarcity of resources and the economic crisis led towards highly biased distribution</p>

<p>of these resources, a recent survey I stumbled upon displayed this on more statistical</p>

<p>terms that the richest 10% of the world’s population earned 9.6 times the total income of</p>

<p>poorest 10%. But we are in 2144 right! Things have more drastic consequences by now</p>

<p>and the Great Artist deprived of all ways finally took matter into his hands to stop his best</p>

<p>creation annhilating all life forms on the planet. With the most regretting emotions and</p>

<p>tearful eyes, with compassion turned into worries and then into anger he finally decided to</p>

<p>wage against humans and their artificiality which promised futile happy endings and</p>

<p>various environmental rehabilitation techniques. Enough of the warnings he said, if they</p>

<p>were wise they would have stopped , and now he began eradication of this so called (self-</p>

<p>proclaimed) intelligent species all alike, he killed all the renowned and destitute alike. No</p>

<p>differences did he notice in their deaths all starved, all drowned, all wanted to live.</p>

<p>But the question remained was why did he create us at the first place now if he didn’t</p>

<p>wanted us to grow, well said he might say but at the end creators when turned devilish by</p>

<p>coercing won’t stop to answer you. Well perhaps this curiosity in humans and their ability</p>

<p>to question existent things and the way they were or their willingness to conclude</p>

<p>everything with logic resulted in their extinction by the hands of those who created them.</p>

<p>Now let the peace prevail.</p>
