    &lt;p&gt;To the blades of green grass,
where my little feet once did tread,
to the river flowing over,
a thousand and one year old bed,
I’ll return ere break of day,
on the last day of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the people that I once called my friend,
and with the people that I still do,
and even with those whom I truly dread,
I’ll go on a tour ere break of day,
to see some long forgotten bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fun which was ended in mid-stride,
my peace that was extinguished so abruptly,
my life which was forced to hide,
will come back to me ere break of day,
and I’ll once again be cheerful and gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you my dear, I will realize,
all our dreams that we dreamed all day and night,
and all our innocent thoughts with no vice,
we’ll think again ere break of day,
by the light of the moon’s last ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that day is nowhere in sight,
so I continue my long and weary fight,
and tread along this tiring road,
without any sign or direction board,
to my supposed paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen by the end of May,
there is nothing definite to say,
but of one thing I am absolutely sure,
that I’ll be whole and my joy will be pure,
on the last day of May,
when I’ll return ere break of day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From hundreds of years, common people in Arab countries were struggling with the problems like political corruption, inflation, unemployment, poverty, human right violations. In the year 2010, the anger against the Government exploded in Tunisia. Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests, riots, and civil wars in the middle-east countries. It then spread like epidemic in the neighbouring countries which were in similar condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from Tunisia, this wave spread to almost all other neighbouring countries. This was first triggered by self-immolation of activist Mohamed Bouazizi in the Tunisian city Sidi Bouzid. Protests started in whole country against Government. Finally, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was exiled by demonstrators and he fled to Saudi Arabia. Egypt, which was facing the similar problems as Tunisia, was inspired by the uprising in Tunisia. Protests started against the government. They were strongly suppressed by President Hosni Mubarak using his power. But protests continued to increase. Finally President resigned and transferred his powers to Armed Forces. At Tahrir Square, Essam Sharaf was appointed as Prime Minister of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations were performed in a similar way in countries like Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. In Libya, protests became more violent as Government tried to oppose protestors using army. After long battles, and with the help of other countries, activists succeeded in overthrowing the Government. President Muammar Gaddafi was brutally killed by opposite forces. In other countries also, Government was ousted and new leaders were chosen by people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New concepts of riots were discovered in these civil wars. The special feature of the Arab Spring was the use of internet services to spread the patriotic wave among people. Protestors used social media to spread their messages. Due to this, Egyptian Government restricted the internet access across the entire nation during civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, Arab Springs succeeded in conveying positive message to the rest of the world, it is so disheartening that the major aims of this revolution were widely disputed.  It has also disappointed those hoping that the removal of corrupt rulers would translate into an instant improvement in living standards because financial damage caused due to war to these already poor countries pushed them into serious trouble of poverty and inflation. The attitude of the government towards this revolution was also shocking. Instead of listening to the demands of people and coming up with a solution, they tried to smash the crowd by using their military powers eventually creating war like conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 170,000 lost their lives in this civil war. Conditions are not normal in these countries till today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movement has disproved the passivity of Arabs towards political issues. It gave a message to the world, that common people will not tolerate any form of injustice against them. We can define Arab Spring as a revolutionary movement done for long term achievements and whose final outcomes are yet to be known.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I would like to start with a story I came across few days back about a possible future event, or perhaps my imagination. It’s about year 2144, what’s the need of being so precise about the date in our hazy future? Not at all! But I required one at least. Being taught to always have faith in the divine force that unites all beings, I wanted one character in the story to reflect this divine force, let’s call him the Great Artist. At the beginning of life the Great Artist as I said created all life forms on earth differentiated and varied with possibilities. But amongst all his makings the only masterpiece he had was man. Man surprised him when he suddenly got up on two limbs and started to use his extra limbs to eat, cook, and create shelter for himself. Overjoyed with the feats of his finest creation and its abilities the Great Artist wished to see more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although with modest stems and a humble start each one this species had a zest to learn and progress. They no more reflected the untamed behaviour of the wild, but instead lived in formations and groups.They developed compassion for their fellows and passed their knowledge as legacies to their children.Not very long after this the Great Artist noticed that there was one thing man couldn’t control himself for and that was his vigour for advancing ahead in life. No matter how much the Great Artist provided him he wasn’t satisfied , rather made himself feel granted towards them owing to his intelligence. Soon the man found out that he was still imperfect with his wishes and his creator didn’t gave him abilities he wished to possess, thus came the machines. Beginning from the very modest bullock cart wheels they progressed and soon became an integrated part man’s life. Machines gave rise to industrial revolution and soon became an inseparable part of human’s life, nearing to 21st century man had inherited enough complex and developed machines from his ancestors whom in turn from their own, that the continuous interaction between him and machines no longer seemed alien to him. Uproar of these artificial machines didn’t please the Great Artist, his mind was in turmoil, he probably didn’t like the prayers emailed to him or online enchantings played during poojas. Over the period of time it occurred to him that a change was required things had already reached the bitter end. Man, although calling him an intelligent being, had made the stupidest of mistakes that threatened the survival of not only his but the entire existence of all living beings on the planet. Overpopulation created scarcity of resources and the economic crisis led towards highly biased distribution of these resources, a recent survey I stumbled upon displayed this on more statistical terms that the richest 10% of the world’s population earned 9.6 times the total income of poorest 10%. But we are in 2144 right! Things have more drastic consequences by now and the Great Artist deprived of all ways finally took matter into his hands to stop his best creation annhilating all life forms on the planet. With the most regretting emotions and tearful eyes, with compassion turned into worries and then into anger he finally decided to wage against humans and their artificiality which promised futile happy endings and various environmental rehabilitation techniques. Enough of the warnings he said, if they were wise they would have stopped , and now he began eradication of this so called (self-proclaimed) intelligent species all alike, he killed all the renowned and destitute alike. No differences did he notice in their deaths all starved, all drowned, all wanted to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question remained was why did he create us at the first place now if he didn’t wanted us to grow, well said he might say but at the end creators when turned devilish by coercing won’t stop to answer you. Well perhaps this curiosity in humans and their ability to question existent things and the way they were or their willingness to conclude everything with logic resulted in their extinction by the hands of those who created them. 
Now let the peace prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
