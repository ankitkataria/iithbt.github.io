From hundreds of years, common people in Arab countries were struggling</p>

<p>with the problems like political corruption, inflation, unemployment, poverty,</p>

<p>human right violations. In the year 2010, the anger against the Government</p>

<p>exploded in Tunisia. Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of demonstrations</p>

<p>and protests, riots, and civil wars in the middle-east countries. It then spread</p>

<p>like epidemic in the neighbouring countries which were in similar condition.</p>

<p>Starting from Tunisia, this wave spread to almost all other neighbouring</p>

<p>countries. This was first triggered by self-immolation of activist Mohamed</p>

<p>Bouazizi in the Tunisian city Sidi Bouzid. Protests started in whole country</p>

<p>against Government. Finally, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was exiled by</p>

<p>demonstrators and he fled to Saudi Arabia. Egypt, which was facing the similar</p>

<p>problems as Tunisia, was inspired by the uprising in Tunisia. Protests started</p>

<p>against the government. They were strongly suppressed by President Hosni</p>

<p>Mubarak using his power. But protests continued to increase. Finally President</p>

<p>resigned and transferred his powers to Armed Forces. At Tahrir Square, Essam</p>

<p>Sharaf was appointed as Prime Minister of Egypt.</p>

<p>Demonstrations were performed in a similar way in countries like Libya, Syria,</p>

<p>Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. In Libya, protests became more violent as</p>

<p>Government tried to oppose protestors using army. After long battles, and</p>

<p>with the help of other countries, activists succeeded in overthrowing the</p>

<p>Government. President Muammar Gaddafi was brutally killed by opposite</p>

<p>forces. In other countries also, Government was ousted and new leaders were</p>

<p>chosen by people.</p>

<p>New concepts of riots were discovered in these civil wars. The special feature</p>

<p>of the Arab Spring was the use of internet services to spread the patriotic wave</p>

<p>among people. Protestors used social media to spread their messages. Due to</p>

<p>this, Egyptian Government restricted the internet access across the entire</p>

<p>nation during civil war.</p>

<p>Though, Arab Springs succeeded in conveying positive message to the rest of</p>

<p>the world, it is so disheartening that the major aims of this revolution were</p>

<p>widely disputed.  It has also disappointed those hoping that the removal of</p>

<p>corrupt rulers would translate into an instant improvement in living standards</p>

<p>because financial damage caused due to war to these already poor countries</p>

<p>pushed them into serious trouble of poverty and inflation. The attitude of the</p>

<p>government towards this revolution was also shocking. Instead of listening to</p>

<p>the demands of people and coming up with a solution, they tried to smash the</p>

<p>crowd by using their military powers eventually creating war like conditions.</p>

<p>About 170,000 lost their lives in this civil war. Conditions are not normal in</p>

<p>these countries till today.</p>

<p>This movement has disproved the passivity of Arabs towards political issues. It</p>

<p>gave a message to the world, that common people will not tolerate any form</p>

<p>of injustice against them. We can define Arab Spring as a revolutionary</p>

<p>movement done for long term achievements and whose final outcomes are yet</p>

<p>to be known.</p>
